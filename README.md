abstract = {The ubiquity of networks in the real world significantly influences dynamic behaviors, with empirical analysis often relying on known network structures to identify network effects. However, inferring latent network structures based solely on observed data remains a challenging inverse problem. To this end, we introduce a new method, Adaptive Lasso with Multi-directional Signals (ALMS), which transforms the network reconstruction problem into a high-dimensional estimation optimization process. ALMS shrinks the coefficients effectively to different directions by adaptive multi-directional penalties, which is able to reduce the estimation bias. Furthermore, we propose a constrained modification, Constrained Adaptive Lasso with Multi-directional Signals (CALMS) to improve both the accuracy and the interpretability of the estimated results. Theoretically, the oracle properties of both the ALMS estimator and the CALMS estimator are established. We demonstrate the excellent finite sample performances of both ALMS and CALMS via comprehensive simulation studies and empirical analysis involving the evolutionary ultimatum game, synchronization model and real experimental data.}
